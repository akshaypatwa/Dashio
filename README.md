 Dashboard with Clean UI
 - Responsive
 - Easy Adaptable
 - Dynamic
 - Low Code 

The dashboard is designed to provide an overview of key metrics and performance indicators for a business. It features a clean and modern design, with interactive charts and graphs that allow users to easily visualize data and track trends over time.

It can be Integrated with any tool such as **ServiceNow or BMC** using Rest API Capabilities.

This code can be reused and modified by changes some variables such as REST API endpoints, styles, design, etc.

I have used JavaScript to power the interactive elements and enable real-time updates. It uses HTML to structure the layout and content of the page, and CSS to style and customize the appearance of the dashboard.

The chart is interactive, allowing users to hover over individual data points to see the exact revenue for a specific month. There is also a bar chart that shows the company's monthly expenses, as well as a pie chart that breaks down expenses by category.

The metrics are displayed in both numeric and graphical formats, making it easy for users to quickly understand and compare data.

Overall, the dashboard provides a comprehensive and intuitive way for users to monitor the performance, display product and service catlogs of the business and make informed decisions.
